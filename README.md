# Machine Learning
Hello, my name is **Sina**.

In this repository, I want to keep records of my own machine learning activities . 

I'm still learning, and this repository contains my efforts to learn about this subject. 

### This repository contains the following files :
| | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | ----------------------------- |
| 1 | [Simple Linear Regresion](https://github.com/siniorone/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Python/01-Simple%20Linear%20Regresion.ipynb) | Build a simple linear regression model based on coronavirus vaccination and mortality rate  |
| 2 | [Polynoial Regression](https://github.com/siniorone/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Python/02-Polynoial%20Regression.ipynb) | In this notebook, we use polynomial regression to improve on our previous model  |
